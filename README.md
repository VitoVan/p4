**Portable Pixel Processing Patch**: Probably Premature, Partially Pointless, Persistently Perplexing Perplexer

A window, native born. Ay, truly native - not veiled in toolkits nor wrapped in widgets. NSWindow whispers on macOS, HWND groans on Windows, and X11 mutters on old stone Linux. These are no illusions. The code speaks their names - aloud, unashamed.

Beneath that native frame lies a simple pixel buffer - raw, direct, and yours to command. No dependencies, no frameworks - just bare Lisp. 

Set pixels, paint patterns, perplex at will.

Thou shalt not optimize prematurely. But thou may perplex liberally.
