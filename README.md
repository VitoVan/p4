**Portable Pixel Processing Patch**: **P**robably **P**remature, **P**artially **P**ointless, **P**ersistently **P**erplexing **P**erplexer

A window, native born. Ay, truly native - not veiled in toolkits nor wrapped in widgets. NSWindow whispers on macOS, HWND groans on Windows, and X11 mutters on old stone Linux.

Beneath that native frame lies a simple pixel buffer - raw, direct, and yours to command. No dependencies, no frameworks - just bare Lisp. 

Set pixels, paint patterns, perplex at will.
